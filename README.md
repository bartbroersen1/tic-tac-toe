FEEDBACK from ChatGPT:

You’ve done a really solid job here! 👏 The code is clean, modular, and you’re already using patterns (IIFEs, encapsulation, factory functions) that many beginners don’t touch until later. Since you asked for improvements, I’ll point out areas that could help you level up without overwhelming you:

🔹 1. Separate Game Logic From DOM

Right now, the Gameplay and DisplayController modules are tightly coupled. For example:

DisplayController.message.textContent = `${Players.getActivePlayer().getName()} is the winner!`;


This means your game logic knows about the UI. Instead, consider having Gameplay only return results (e.g., "winner", "tie", "continue") and let the DisplayController handle what to do with those results.

For example:

const playRound = (row, column) => {
    if (Gameboard.getCellValue(row, column) !== null) return "invalid";

    Gameboard.setCellValue(row, column, Players.getActivePlayer().getPlayerValue());

    if (Gameboard.checkWinningLines()) return { result: "winner", player: Players.getActivePlayer() };
    if (Gameboard.checkForTie()) return { result: "tie" };

    Players.toggleActivePlayer();
    return { result: "continue", player: Players.getActivePlayer() };
};


Then your UI layer (DisplayController) decides what message to show.

🔹 2. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

You have some repetition in buildWinningLines and checkWinningLines. For example, you loop twice to build diagonals — those could be merged into a single loop.

const winningDiagonalOne = [];
const winningDiagonalTwo = [];
for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    winningDiagonalOne.push(board[i][i]);
    winningDiagonalTwo.push(board[i][rows - 1 - i]);
}
winningLines.push(winningDiagonalOne, winningDiagonalTwo);


That makes it shorter and more readable.

🔹 3. Improve Player Handling

Instead of using prompt inside the Players module (which mixes logic and UI), pass in names when creating players. For example:

const createPlayer = (name, symbol) => ({ name, symbol });


Then in setup:

const playerOne = createPlayer("Alice", "X");
const playerTwo = createPlayer("Bob", "O");


This way, if you want to move to a nicer form-based UI later, you don’t have to rewrite logic.

🔹 4. Error & Edge Case Handling

Currently, if someone clicks on an already filled cell, nothing happens silently. Consider giving feedback like "Cell already taken!".

🔹 5. More Readable DOM Updates

Instead of clearing and re-rendering the whole board each time, you could just update the clicked cell. This is a small optimization:

const updateCell = (row, col) => {
    const cell = document.querySelector(`[data-row='${row}'][data-column='${col}']`);
    cell.textContent = Gameboard.getCellValue(row, col);
};

🔹 6. Style / Readability

Use consistent semicolons (you sometimes use them, sometimes not).

Favor const over let where possible — e.g., in buildWinningLines for winningDiagonalOne and winningDiagonalTwo, they don’t change.

Use early returns to reduce nested if statements. For example in playRound:

if (Gameboard.getCellValue(row, column) !== null) return;
if (Gameboard.checkWinningLines()) return;


This avoids a deep nesting structure.

🔹 7. Future Ideas

Add score tracking (player wins counter).

Add a mode for "Player vs Computer" with a simple AI.

Use CSS transitions to animate moves.

Let players pick their symbol ("X" or "O").

✅ Overall:
You’re structuring this like a pro already. The biggest improvement would be to separate UI and logic — that’s the thing that will make your code much easier to extend in the future.

Would you like me to refactor your Gameplay and DisplayController modules into a cleaner separation (logic vs UI) so you can see how it looks in practice?
